# 🐍 Snake

Snake is a classic arcade game in which the player needs to control a snake to increase its length, eat food and avoid collisions with walls and its own tail.

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of the game is to score the maximum number of points by eating food that randomly appears on the playing field. Every time the snake eats food, it gets longer. However, as she grows, the player must be careful not to run into her tail, otherwise the game will end.

## 🕹️ Control

> W, A, S, D

The snake is controlled using the keys on the keyboard. The snake moves in a straight line and the player must indicate its direction using the left or right turn keys. If the snake reaches the edge of the playing field, it appears on the opposite side.
