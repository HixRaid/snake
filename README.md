## 🎯 Goal

The goal of the game is to score the maximum number of points by eating food that appears randomly on the playing field. Every time the snake eats food, it gets longer. However, as she grows, the player must be careful not to run into her tail or the wall, otherwise the game ends.

## 🕹️ Control

> W, A, S, D

The snake is controlled using the keys on the keyboard. The snake moves in a straight line and the player must indicate its direction using the left or right turn keys. If the snake reaches the edge of the playing field, it appears on the opposite side.
